## Summer School on Crowdsourcing and IoT

The summer school focuses on combining objective measurement data from mobile sensors, like smart devices or IoT devices, and subjective ratings. This enables assessing environmental factors in QoE studies and adding context information to sensor data measurements. The program of the summer school includes a general introduction in the research areas of crowdsourcing and mobile sensing. Best practices for subjective assessments will be given as well as selected Topics on IOT. The statistical evaluation of measurements and subjective user studies is taken into account.

The summer school takes place in W&uuml;rzburg, Germany from July 31st to August 4th, 2017.
