    The Crowdsourcing Summer School 2017 intends to deepen knowledge in crowdsourcing and using crowdsourcing for subjective user studies. The goal is to bring together advanced testing methodologies and quality assessment of novel applications.

The summer school takes place in ... The number of places is limited. Therefore, we encourage you to apply and register for the Crowdsourcing Summer School as soon as possible: Registration.
The summer school will cover the following topics.

        <ul>
            <li>Crowdsourcing in general, common platforms and existing QoE frameworks</li>
            <li>Best practices and mechanisms in crowdsourcing, data quality, incentives and gamification</li>
            <li>Quality assessment, statistical analysis and machine learning of subjective user studies</li>
            <li>Novel applications in the area of crowdsourcing</li>
        </ul>


<h3>Application and Registration</h3>

The application for the Crowdsourcing summer school is now open and closes.
The application and registration form can be filled at Registration until.
Submission of an extended abstract in not required for participation.
Registration fee for the summer school: 250 Euro.
The number of places is limited to 30 participants.

In the registration form, you will be asked several questions in order to find groups of researchers interested in the same topic and to do joint group work: What is your main motivation to participate in the summer school? What is your current research?  What kind of crowdsourcing experiment or QoE study would you like to conduct?

<h3>Who can participate?</h3>
PhD Students are welcome to participate in the summer school, especially when working in the field of quality assessment, subjective user studies, or crowdsourcing. MS Students, Post Docs, and Researchers working in the same field are welcome to participate (upon availability).

<h3>Joint Group Work</h3>
The concept of this summer school is to form research groups of PhD students supervised by a tutor. Thereby, the PhD students will be grouped according to their research interests. Before the summer school, these groups will already start discussing about potential research questions and how to investigate them. A poster presentation of the group's ideas will take place during the summer school in order to foster collaboration and innovation between all groups.

During the summer school, the groups will get time to jointly research on their common topic with the support and help of the tutor. Crowdsourcing experiments may be conducted and the results analyzed statistically in order to investigate new and interesting research questions. In the end, this may result in a joint publication of the research group.
