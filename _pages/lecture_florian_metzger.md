This lecture aims to outfit you with a basic toolset for you to start your own IoT and Crowdsensing research projects. In a broad overview we cover many networking aspects, from simple radio and propagation aspects up the protocol stack to specialised application layer protocols. Additionally, special attention is given to often overlooked influences of network control plane aspects of mobile networks, which become especially critical with the large number of devices IoT networks strive to consist of.
