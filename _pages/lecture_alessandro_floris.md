The evaluation of the performance of IoT applications is becoming more and more important as relevant deployments are ubiquitously present in our everyday life activities, such as smart cities, smart homes, and smart transportation systems.
Existing evaluation models are based on QoS (Quality of Service) measures but recent efforts are in the direction of evaluating the QoE (Quality of Experience), which aims at assessing how end-users subjectively perceive the quality of an application or a service.
This lecture tackles the challenge of Quality of Experience evaluation of IoT applications and services.
A reference IoT architecture is considered to provide guidelines on which influence factors should be measured for the evaluation and management of the QoE in different application scenarios.
Besides QoS, data and information-related measures, namely Quality of Data (QoD) and Quality of Information (QoI) are introduced and discussed.
Furthermore, the concept of Multimedia IoT (MIoT) is introduced in order to focus on the applications in which people are involved as the end-users of the multimedia content provided by the MIoT applications.
On the basis of these concepts, a layered QoE management framework is defined aimed at evaluating and controlling the contributions of each influence factor to estimate the overall QoE in MIoT applications.
Finally, some practical use cases are investigated.
