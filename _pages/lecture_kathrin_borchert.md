Crowdsourcing offers the possibility to gain access to a huge number of potential participants for research studies, e.g. QoE studies.
 While realizing and conducting such studies on crowdsourcing platforms, new challenges arise which differ from known challenges of studies in laboratory environments.
This lecture gives a short introduction to crowdsourcing, especially to microtasking and a brief overview of commonly used platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk and Microworkers.
 Further, the lecture discusses how to design and realize crowdsourcing studies focussing on factors which affect the quality of the output of the conducted studies.
