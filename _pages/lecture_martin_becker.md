Participatory sensing refers to the process of generating knowledge from data provided by a possibly large amount of volunteers. 
Such data can be from a very diverse set of domains and the results depend strongly on the quality as well as the density of the data.
This lecture gives a short overview on participatory sensing in the context of urban environments and summarize some tools, methodology and results focusing on the EU project "EveryAware" which aimed at enhancing environmental awareness through social information technologies.

Martin Becker has studied computer science at the University of W&uuml;rzburg and the University of Texas at Austin.
Afterwards he was employed by the L3S Research center working on the the EU project "EveryAware" for enhancing environmental awareness through social information technologies.
Then during his time at the University of W&uuml;rzburg he was involved in several projects from the fields of emerging semantics, digital humanities, human mobility and the quantified self.
Recently he is also contributing to the DFG project "Learning Environmental Maps" which aims at using participatory sensing for deriving accurate and interpretable air quality maps.
