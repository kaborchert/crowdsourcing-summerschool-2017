---

First we briefly state the different scientific challenges arising from Internet-of-Things and its required new network and computing concepts.
Then we discuss the software architectures and protocol stacks of a Fog Computing approach and its special case Mobile Edge Computing (MEC).
As third step we present a lightweight virtualization concept derived from the rapidly evolving container virtualization suite Docker and its Swarm mode.
We illustrate how the latter framework can be applied to realize effectively new IoT applications on clustered single-board computers like Raspberry Pi's or Clearfog boards.
We demonstrate our concepts by our recently developed Fog Computing platform HCL-BaFog which has been built by means of Hypriot Cluster Lab (HCL).  
 
All presented software components are publically available as open source. The presented Fog Computing concepts will then be learnt by a hands-on session.
